# Natural Language Processing for the Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Prevention

This project involves utilizing NLP topic modeling and sentiment analysis for the [Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Prevention (JCRP)](https://journals.lww.com/jcrjournal/pages/default.aspx). I was recruited by the editor of the journal to explore changes to the journal that have occurred over the past few years.
