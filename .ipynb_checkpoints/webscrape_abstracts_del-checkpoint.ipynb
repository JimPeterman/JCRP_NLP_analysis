      "We examined the agreement between peak oxygen uptake (V˙o2peak), estimated using prediction equations from the 6-min Walk Test (6MWT), and V˙o2peak measured using a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) to estimate change in V˙o2peak in patients with heart failure (HF) enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation (CR). This was secondary analysis of 54 (including 9 women) patients with HF who completed a clinical CR program. Four previously published equations using 6MWT distance were used to estimate V˙o2peak and were compared with a CPX at baseline, follow-up, and change using the standard and modified Bland-Altman method. Analyses were repeated for quartiles of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) based on measured V˙o2peak from the CPX. Bland-Altman plots revealed proportional bias between all prediction equations and the measured V˙o2peak. The difference between methods varied by the level of CRF, with overestimation of prediction equations at greater levels of CRF and underestimation at lower levels of CRF. This poor agreement remained when comparisons were made between the estimated and measured V˙o2peak values at quartiles of CRF, indicating prediction equations have limited ability to predict V˙o2peak at any level of CRF. Estimated V˙o2peak using 6MWT distance demonstrated poor agreement with measured V˙o2peak from a CPX. While distance ambulated on the 6MWT remains an important measure of physical performance in patients with HF, prediction equations using 6MWT distance are not appropriate to monitor changes in V˙o2peak following CR in patients with HF.\n"

Such was the case for the field of cardiac rehabilitation in 1981. Whereas a growing body of literature was demonstrating benefits of exercise in cardiac patients with regard to clinical, psychologic, and quality-of-life outcomes,1,2 there were still concerns about the safety of exercise and whether it could be widely adapted in clinical care. Since this was a time period when searches of online databases such as PubMed had not yet been established (began in 1996), there was a great value of concentrating much of the cardiac rehabilitation literature in a single journal.\n",
      "This commentary describes the conceptualization and implementation of the Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Prevention from 1981 to the present and its acceptance as the official journal of the American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation and later the Canadian Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation. The commentary also highlights the journal's inclusion in Index Medicus in 1995, its receipt of an impact factor from International Scientific Indexing in 2007, and its publication of many important scientific statements, often in collaboration with major scientific organizations such as the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.\n"
